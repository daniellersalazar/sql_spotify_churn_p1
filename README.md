# sql_spotify_churn_p1
This project explores user behavior in a simulated music streaming dataset using PostgreSQL (pgAdmin4). I designed and executed SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and churn analysis. Key insights include subscription trends, churn rates, listening behavior, and engagement by demographics and device type.
